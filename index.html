		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I'm a compliance officer for a financial services firm by trade.  What I enjoy most about my job is learning how things work, analyzing data, and working through complex issues to get an answer.  I'm learning how to code because I'd eventually like to create automated solutions for others, and I enjoy learning how things work.</p>
